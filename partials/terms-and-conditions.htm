<p>These terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern (i) the Dallas Museum of Art's websites and (ii) participation in the Dallas Museum of Art’s Friends program.</p>

<p>1. DMA Friends. In addition to the other terms set forth in the Museum’s more generally-applicable Terms & Conditions (http://dma.org/termsConditions), the following terms and conditions apply to participation in the Friends program:</p>

<p>a. DMA Friends is a free program that allows you to discover new and fun activities at the Museum. The Museum has created recognition markers, called badges, that are awarded to participating Friends. Typically, you earn credit towards badges by entering activity codes, which may be provided at various locations, in the Museum or elsewhere, and/or may be distributed by DMA staff. Earning badges unlocks special rewards and recognition (“Rewards”) like free tickets, behind-the-scenes tours, discounts on shopping and dining, and access to exclusive experiences at the Museum. Children under the age of 13 may not participate in the Friends program, but the Museum is exploring opportunities for increased involvement of children with the Museum, and we will be sure to inform you when those opportunities become available.</p>

<p>b. You must provide your name and an e-mail address or mobile phone number to establish a Friends program account. If you’re already a DMA Partner, you may use your Partner card to log in and we will link your accounts together. Your e-mail address or mobile phone number may be used to access your Friend account. You will also receive a membership card, and you will select or be provided with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that is used for security and verification purposes. Your membership card and PIN code are private, and it is your responsibility to keep them secure. The Museum will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of your Friends account using your membership card or PIN, so please report any loss or compromise of your membership card or PIN to the Museum right away.</p>

<p>c. You can use text messaging to check in when you visit the Museum, register your participation in activities at the Museum, and check on your account status. If you indicate your permission on the Friends website or at any Friends kiosk, we may communicate with you regarding the Friends program until or unless you opt out of receiving such messages. Each mobile phone number must be associated with only one Friends account. Also, if you send the Museum a text message, you understand and agree that we may send a response to you by text message. Only the mobile phone number linked to your Friends account can be used to check-in, enter activity codes, or otherwise participate in the Friends program. In all cases, your mobile carrier may asse</p>ss charges for text messages that you send or receive, and all such charges are your responsibility.

<p>d. If you do not choose one of the images offered by the Museum, you may upload an image of yourself for use in connection with your Friends profile, and you grant the Museum a perpetual, royalty-free license to use and publish that image for viewing by you and others in connection with the Friends program. Images that include other people and images to which the copyright is held by another person are prohibited. The Museum reserves the right to decline to post or to remove any submitted image that the Museum believes may be offensive. Any and all uploaded images and other material constitute User Materials and are governed by the applicable terms set forth in the Museum’s more generally-applicable (http://www.dma.org/termsConditions).</p>

<p>e. Rewards are subject to availability and shall have no cash value. The Museum reserves the right to modify the list of Rewards available for redemption, as well as the requirements to earn any Rewards, at any time and for any reason in the Museum’s sole and absolute discretion, even though such modification may affect your ability to use accumulated credit for participation in the Friends program. The Museum reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to modify or terminate the Friends program. Upon termination of the program, you will have thirty (30) days from the program termination date to redeem credits, but will not be able to earn additional credit during that thirty (30) day period. Thereafter, any accrued activity credit and any earned badges will have no value of any kind and will be forfeited without compensation, and no Rewards may be redeemed.</p>

<p>f. To redeem Rewards, review the Rewards listed on the Friends website or available using one of the Friends kiosks in the Museum. Friends may select any Reward still available for sufficient credit has been accumulated. All Reward redemptions are final and are subject to any applicable, posted date and/or age restrictions. When you redeem a Reward, you will receive a voucher or confirmation e-mail message with instructions explaining how to claim your Reward. E-mail messages will be sent to the e-mail address in your Friends profile. You are responsible for ensuring that your Friends profile is accurate and current. Any applicable duties or taxes associated with or arising from any Reward are not included and are your responsibility.</p>

<p>g. As a condition of receiving any Reward, you acknowledge and agree that, if a Reward includes any goods or services provided by a third party, the Museum shall have no responsibility and disclaims all express or implied warranties associated with such goods or services to the fullest extent permissible by law. Any third-party goods and services including as part of a Reward shall be subject to the applicable terms, conditions, and warranty, if any, of the third party.</p>

If you choose to provide any social media usernames or “handles” in connection with your Friends account, you represent that such usernames or “handles” are yours.
