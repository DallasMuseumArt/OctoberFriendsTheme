Your account has been successfully created. We would like to welcome you to your Museum as our newest DMA Friend. A member of our Visitor Services staff will call your name soon and give you a freshly printed DMA Friend card. Feel free to ask any questions about being a DMA Friend.

You can begin participating in DMA Friends immediately with your new card, your mobile phone, or by using an iPad kiosk located around the Museum. Browse the badges weâ€™ve created to get ideas for some fun ways to plug in at the Museum or ask a staff member about ways you can participate.
