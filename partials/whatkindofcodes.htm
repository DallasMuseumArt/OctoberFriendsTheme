<p>Activity Codes are available in various places around the Museum, at programs, and in galleries, and special “hidden” codes may occasionally be distributed by DMA staff.</p>

<p>
These codes may be entered at any DMA Friends kiosk, or you can text the code to 214-390-9693. (Be sure you’ve linked your mobile phone number to your Friends account first so we know who is calling.)</p>
